      "In a context where trust in electoral processes is fundamental, Tu Voto Decide emerges as a blockchain-based solution for citizen monitoring.",
      "This application allows users to create a sovereign digital identity integrated with the Wira Wallet ecosystem. Individuals register by validating their information through artificial intelligence, which compares a selfie with official data. Once the identity is registered, users can capture photos of electoral records, sign them electronically and convert them into NFTs to ensure their authenticity.",
      "Other participants download these records to validate them, and the results are consolidated on the blockchain, offering unalterable transparency. The pilot will be launched in the general elections of Bolivia 2025, with emphasis on the second round, and will expand to municipal, national and international levels for institutions that require secure electronic voting."
